This console app is a representation of an accessible voting system that displays a ballot with multiple contests, and allows the user to navigate and select candidates using numbers on a keypad. The program draws data from local JSON files that contain data on the ballot and contests. 

# Features: 

- Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program

- Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application

- Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program
